# Tasks: 基础项目框架搭建

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-project-framework-setup/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume web app structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 [P] Create backend directory structure in `backend/`
- [ ] T003 [P] Create frontend directory structure in `frontend/`
- [ ] T004 [P] Create root level documentation in `docs/`
- [ ] T005 [P] Create global configuration files (`.env.example`, `.gitignore`)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

**Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):**

- [ ] T006 Create backend requirements.txt with FastAPI dependencies
- [ ] T007 Create frontend package.json with Vue3 and Vite dependencies
- [ ] T008 [P] Setup backend configuration management in `backend/src/config/`
- [ ] T009 [P] Setup frontend configuration management in `frontend/src/config/`
- [ ] T010 Create backend main application entry point in `backend/src/main.py`
- [ ] T011 Create frontend main application entry point in `frontend/src/main.js`
- [ ] T012 Configure backend logging system in `backend/src/config/logging.py`
- [ ] T013 Configure frontend build system in `frontend/vite.config.js`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2/US3 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tasks within a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all backend configuration tasks together:
Task: "Create backend service configuration model in backend/src/config/settings.py"
Task: "Implement backend configuration validation in backend/src/config/validation.py"

# Launch all backend API tasks together:
Task: "Implement health check endpoint in backend/src/api/routes/health.py"
Task: "Implement root route endpoint in backend/src/api/routes/root.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Backend Service)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Backend)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Frontend)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Configuration)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Routing)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (if tests requested)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 60
**User Story Breakdown**:
- User Story 1 (Backend Service): 11 tasks
- User Story 2 (Frontend Service): 11 tasks
- User Story 3 (Configuration): 9 tasks
- User Story 4 (Routing): 9 tasks
- Setup & Foundational: 13 tasks
- Polish & Cross-cutting: 7 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 45 out of 60 tasks can run in parallel (75%)
**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (11 tasks after foundational)
**Estimated MVP Timeline**: 2-3 days with proper testing
